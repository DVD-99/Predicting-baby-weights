# Predicting baby weights with linear regression using Gradient Descent

Linear regression is perhaps one of the most well known and well understood algorithms in statistics and machine learning.

```baby-weights-dataset.csv``` has baby weights:
* It has 35 features for each baby weight.
* It has 101400 records.
* The last column are the baby weights.
* data-description.txt has detailed explanation of each feature.

The ```linear_regression_SGD.ipynb``` is divided into two tasks
1. Preprocessing of Data & Data Analysis.
2. Implementing the linear regression using gradient descent.

Finally use the trained model on ```judge-without-labels.csv``` to predict the baby weights for unknown data.
